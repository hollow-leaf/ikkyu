### Description

Ikkyu platform is a playful and engaging crypto experience inspired by meme coins. Users can pump tokens using their smartphone's accelerometer combined with ZKTLS (zero-knowledge trust layer) for secure interactions. Token issuance is tied to earning merit points through platform activities, fostering meaningful engagement and social FOMO.

This project is designed to gamify meme coins, turning them into a dynamic cultural movement while blending technology, fun, and spirituality.
